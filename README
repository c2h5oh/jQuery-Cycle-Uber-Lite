This is an attempt to make the lowest footpring possible image cycle (rotator) plugin. 

1. Functions planned:
+ single transition animation (done)
+ simple next/prev navigation (done)
+ stop on hover (done)
+ multiple plugin instances on page support (done)
+ lazy load (what's the point of shaving 2kb off jQuery plugin if you're going to load 500KB of jpegs even before the js is executed?) (done)

2. The target:
+ less than 2KB of minified code including CSS - almost: missed by 5%
+ less than 1KB of gzipped code - done: 803b exactly
+ IE6+, FF2+, Opera 9+, Chrome 3+ support - partially done: works fine in IE7, IE8 and IE9, Opera 10+ (older not yet tested), Chrome (old versions not yet tested) and Firefox 4+ (older versions not yet tested). Minor styling issues in IE6, also in IE6 transition is not smooth enough, but reducing animation framerate should do the trick  
+ Has to run perfectly smooth on ancient gear and even leave some processing power for other tasks - will be tested on P3 + 256 MB RAM laptop running Windows 2000 + IE6 - not tested yet, most likely will require lowered animation framerate 

3. TODO:
+ cross browser testing
+ performance profiling
+ usage examples

4.How to use:

Basic example:
HTML - put links with images as anchor or just images in a container:
<div id="container_name">
	<a href="/link1"><img src="img1.jpg" alt="1st image" /></a>
	<a href="/link2"><img src="img2.jpg" alt="2nd image" /></a>	
	...
	<a href="/linkN"><img src="imgN.jpg" alt="Nth image" /></a>
</div>

or

<div id="container_name">
	<img src="img1.jpg" alt="1st image" />
	<img src="img2.jpg" alt="2nd image" />	
	...
	<img src="imgN.jpg" alt="Nth image" />
</div>

Java Script:
<script type="text/javascript">				
	$(document).ready(function() {					
		$('#container_name').jQLiteCycle();
	});
</script> 

With lazy load (load images beyond 1st on document.ready):
HTML as in basic example, but put only 1st link/image in container
<div id="container_name">
	<a href="/link1"><img src="img1.jpg" alt="1st image" /></a>	
</div>

Java Script:
<script type="text/javascript">				
	$(document).ready(function() {					
		$('#container_name').jQLiteCycle({
			lazyLoad:'<a href="/link2"><img src="img2.jpg" alt="2nd image" /></a>	
			<a href="/link3"><img src="img3.jpg" alt="3rd image" /></a>
			...
			<a href="/linkN"><img src="imgN.jpg" alt="Nth image" /></a>'
		});
	});
</script>
