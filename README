This is an attempt to make the lowest footpring possible image cycle (rotator) plugin. 

Functions planned:
+ single transition animation (done)
+ simple next/prev navigation (done)
+ stop on hover (done)
+ multiple plugin instances on page support (done)
+ lazy load (what's the point of shaving 2kb off jQuery plugin if you're going to load 500KB of jpegs even before the js is executed?) (done)

The target:
+ less than 2KB of minified code including CSS - almost: missed by 5%
+ less than 1KB of gzipped code - done: 803b exactly
+ IE6+, FF2+, Opera 9+, Chrome 3+ support - not tested yet
+ Has to run perfectly smooth on ancient gear and even leave some processing power for other tasks - will be tested on P3 + 256 MB RAM laptop running Windows 2000 + IE6 - not tested yet, most likely will require lowered animation framerate 

TODO:
+ cross browser testing
+ performance profiling
+ usage examples
