This is an attempt to make the lowest footpring possible image cycle (rotator) plugin. 

Functions planned:
+ single transition animation (fade)
+ simple next/prev navigation (done)
+ stop on hover (done)
+ multiple plugin instances on page support (done)
+ lazy load (what's the point of shaving 2kb off jQuery plugin if you're going to load 500KB of jpegs even before the js is executed?) (done)

The target:
+ less than 2KB of minified code including CSS
+ less than 1KB of gzipped code
+ IE6+, FF2+, Opera 9+, Chrome 3+ support
+ Has to run perfectly smooth on ancient gear and even leave some processing power for other tasks - will be tested on P3 + 256 MB RAM laptop running Windows 2000 + IE6 

Changelog:

0.1 - 02/09/2011
+ initial plugin commits
+ most of the code ready, no transition code yet.
