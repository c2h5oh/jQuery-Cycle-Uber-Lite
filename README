This is an attempt to make the lowest footprint possible image cycle (rotator) plugin. Quite successful one :P 

1. Simple, bare essentials image cycle plugin:
- single transition animation
- simple next/prev navigation
- stop on hover
- multiple plugin instances on page support


2. Cross browser compatible
- Internet Explorer 6+ (tested 6,7,8 and 9)
- Firefox 2+ (tested all major releases)
- Opera 9.5 (tested major releases, might be compatible with older versions as well)
- Chrome 3+ (tested most major releases)

3. It's fast and tiny
- it's 2.07KB when minified
- it's 820 Bytes when gzipped
- it's a single js file (no images, css - single HTTP request)
- it has support for lazy loading (you load 1st image to be cycled and remaining ones are loaded later, when document is ready and user is waiting for another slide - this can MASSIVELY speed up perceived loading times)
- to reduce CPU load runs on minimum smooth animation frame rate (default for jQuery: 70FPS, default for plugin: 30FPS) - it's usable even on old P3 256MB RAM laptop running Windows 2000 + IE6

3. TODO:
+ usage example files


4.How to use:

Basic example:
HTML - put links with images as anchor or just images in a container:
<div id="container_name">
	<a href="/link1"><img src="img1.jpg" alt="1st image" /></a>
	<a href="/link2"><img src="img2.jpg" alt="2nd image" /></a>	
	...
	<a href="/linkN"><img src="imgN.jpg" alt="Nth image" /></a>
</div>

or

<div id="container_name">
	<img src="img1.jpg" alt="1st image" />
	<img src="img2.jpg" alt="2nd image" />	
	...
	<img src="imgN.jpg" alt="Nth image" />
</div>

Java Script:
<script type="text/javascript">				
	$(document).ready(function() {					
		$('#container_name').jQLiteCycle();
	});
</script> 

With lazy load (load images beyond 1st on document.ready):
HTML as in basic example, but put only 1st link/image in container
<div id="container_name">
	<a href="/link1"><img src="img1.jpg" alt="1st image" /></a>	
</div>

Java Script:
<script type="text/javascript">				
	$(document).ready(function() {					
		$('#container_name').jQLiteCycle({
			lazyLoad:'<a href="/link2"><img src="img2.jpg" alt="2nd image" /></a>	
			<a href="/link3"><img src="img3.jpg" alt="3rd image" /></a>
			...
			<a href="/linkN"><img src="imgN.jpg" alt="Nth image" /></a>'
		});
	});
</script>
